# Stems

Q. which is the bud at the end of the twig producing tissue to grow the length of the twig?
A. **Terminal Bud**

Q. whats region of stem where leaves are attached?
A. **node**

Q. What else is found at the nodes?
- A. **axillary buds**
	- petiole = how leaf is attached to stem

Q. What kind of tissue is responsible for growth in plants?
A. **Meristem**

## Dicots 

- pith in center
	- storage = food

## Monocot stems

- Vascular bundles
	- xylem and phloam scattered throughout stem
	- no vascular cambium or cork cambium
	- ground tissue found between bundles
- cant form seconday tissues (wood) 
- surrounded by epidermis

## Specialized stems

- rhizome
	- ginger (monocot)
		- lines (nodes) visible
	- iris (monocot)
	- underground
	- stores starches
		- stored through winter

- runners
	- horizontal stems above ground
	- strawberry

- Stolons
	- potato
		- shoots (buds) grow from nodes

- Tubers

- bulbs 
	- onion, dafodil
	- tough outer layer (leaves)

- Corms 
	- mostly stem tissue
	- look like bulbs

- Cladophylls 
	- flattened leaf like stems
	- prickly pear cactus, succulents, asperagus
		- function for photosynthesis

- thorns
	- modified stem for protection
		- deter herbivores
	- vs. spline = modified leaf
		- is it coming before or in place of the leaf?
