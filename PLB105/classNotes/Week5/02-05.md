# Stems

## Intro to Stems

- Often largest mass of plant
- Function
	- support/structure
	- attach organs
		- flowers/leaves
	- transport
		- minerals, sugars
		- water from roots
	- diff forms
		- woody, herbaceous, upright stems connected underground by horiz stems
- growth patterns
	- indeterminate
		- will continue growing indefinitely
		- pole beans
	- determinate
		- will stop growing at some point
		- example: seasonal changes bring on flowering
		- bush beans

## Anatomy of Woody Twig

- Axis attached to leaves
	- **Node** - area where leaves are attached
	- **Axil** - angle betwen petiole and stem
		 - **axillary bud** - located in axil
	- **Terminal bud** - at twig tip
- Lenticil allows for exchange of gases

## Decidous Trees or Shrubs

## Class questions 

Q. Bud at the end of the twig that is responsible for producing tissue during 
growing season?
A. **Terminal bud**

Q. Region of stem where leaves are attached is called:
- A. **node**
	- helps for plant identification
	- internode length is distinct between species

## Origin and Development of Stems

- Apical meristem at tip
	- increases stem length
	- dormant before growing season
	- protected by **bud scales**
- Protoderm on outside
	- early stage of epidermis
- Procambium on inside
	- vascular tissues
		- primary xylem, phloem
- Ground meristem
	- parenchyma cells
		- pith and cortex

## Herbaceous Dicot stems

- Annuals - die after going from seed to maturity in one year

- Epidermis outside
- Cortex next layer
- Vascular bundles next
	- arranged in a cylinder
	- vascular cambium
		- adds secondary xylem/phloem
		- xylem center
		- phloem outside
- pith very inside
	- spongy interior

## Vascular tissue

- Xylem
	- conducting tissue for water and minerals
	- absorbed from roots
	- composed of vessels and tracheids
		- dead at maturity
- Phloem
	- transport food, photosynthetic products
	- alive at maturity
	- sieve tube members

Q. Select true about vascular bundles in herbaceous dicot stem:
- A. arranged in a cylinder (stele)
	- maintain structure and grow outward
	- become solid ring all the way around
	- cohesive circular growth

- Vascular Cambium

- Cork cambium
	- produced within suberin
	- reduces water loss and protects stem
	- lenticles here

## Woody Dicot stem

- Tree rings
	- distinct regions in cross section
	- transport much less water in summer than in spring
	- environment impacts size of rings
		- if no fluctuation in water intake, no rings
		- near equator (tropical)
	- xylem growth in one year = one tree ring
- Conifer stems
	- sapwood
		- dead at maturity (xylem)
		- actively moving water
		- lighter region near outside
	- hartwood
		- dormant, only there for structure
		- darker wood in center
- Annual rings
	- one year of xylem growth
	- Vascular rays
		- parenchyma cells that transport things through cross section

Q. Where is vascular cambium located in stem?
- A. between primary xylem and primary phloem, wherever theyre found
	- produces xylem to the center

Q. What secondary xylem does vascular cambium produce in addition to vessel elements in woody dicots?
- A. Tracheids
	- Sieve tube members in phloem

## Softwood vs hardwood

- softwood = conifers
	- no fibers or vessel elements
- hardwood = maple, cherry, oak etc.
	- fibers and vessel elements make it harder

## bark

- tissue outside vascular cambium
