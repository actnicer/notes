# Chp. 5 - Roots and Soils 

## Mycorrhizae

- Fungi create network where they can absorb sugars (dextrose)
	- whole system takes in more water than it could alone


## Root Nodules
	
- Soy beans, other legumes, clover in vid
- nodules contain **nitrogen-fixing bacteria**
	- enzyme which break down nitrogen
- nitrogen in nodule bearing plants become available to other plants by enriching the soil
	- contain hemogloben same as our blood

## Class Question 

Q. When two organisms depend on one another for survival, their relationship is:
A. **Mutualistic**

Q. In mycorrhizae assoc. what does the plant provide to fungus and vice versa? 
- A. **Plant provides org. food, fungi provide mineral nutrients**
	- organic means carbon based (sugars or carbohydrates)

Q. On legumes, root nodules are specialized root tissues that surround and house nitrogen-fixing `____`:
A. **Bacteria**

- crispy lychen

# Chpt 5 - Soils

- Soils are divided into horizons (layers)
	- Topsoil (A horizon)
		- 10-20 cm
		- Mycorhizae found here
		- **Microbes** - decomposing things for nutrients
		- contains decaying organic matter and living soil organisms
	- Subsoil (B horizon)
		- 0.3m-0.9m
		- More clay, lighter in color
	- C Horizon
		- Rocks in the process of breaking down (weathering)
	- R Horizon
		- solid rock, called **parent material**

## Soil Formation

- Interaction of:
	- Climate
		- Desert: little weathering with water, soils poorly developed
		- Moderate rainfall == Well developed soils
		- High rainfall == soil leaches out important minerals
	- Parent material
	- topography
		- steep areas - can lead to too much erosion
		- flat areas - can lead to pooling, soil development arrested
	- vegetation
		- Aerate soils - create air pockets
		- **Hummus** - decomposed organic material, gives dark color
	- living organisms
	- time

#### Class Questions

Q. Select all components of soils:
A. **Organic material, air, minerals, organisms**

Q. Pore spaces in soil are shared by variable amount of water and `___`:
A. **Air**

Q. Soil formation begins when rocks are broken down into `___` material:
- A. **Parent**
	- Question phrased backwards

Q. Choose correct order of soil particles (small to large)
- A. **Clay -> silt -> sand** -> gravel
	- different soils allow different drainage

## Soil Texture and Mineral Composition

- Soil Texture (largest to smallest)
	- Sand
		- small particles bound chemically
	- Silt
		- particles only seen w/ microscope
	- Clay
		- particles seen w/ electron microscope

## Agricultural Soils

- Best soils
	- **Loam** - 40% silt, 40% sand, 20% clay
		- allows for perfect level of drainage 

## Water in Soil



- Hygroscopic Water
	- physically bound to plants
	- unavailable to plants
	- enacts permenant wilting point 
- Capillary Water
	- plants mostly depend on this
	- available to plants
	- held against the force of gravity in soil pores
	- Q. What characterstic of water allows capillary water to be held against the force of gravity in soil pores? 
	- A. **Adhesion, cohesion, surface tension, viscosity**
		- water holding onto others and itself (adhesion, cohesion)
- Gravitational Water
	- max amount field can hold without being overloaded 
	- called **field capacity** - water remaining in soil after water drains away by gravity

## Soil pH

- Affects nutrient availability
	- Alkalinity, acidity effects the availability of certain minerals
	- acid rain can make soils too acidic
