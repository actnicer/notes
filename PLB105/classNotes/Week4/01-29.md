# Chp 5 - Roots and Soils

[class slides](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/1856668/viewContent/15537715/View)

## What is a root?

- anchors the plants 
- where plants take in nutrients and water
- store carbs and water for human consumption

## How roots develop

- Taproot System
	- solid main structure with small branch offs
	- Dicots have this system
	- sweet potato
- Fibrous System
	- no main, all same size and branch out evenly
	- Monocots have this system
	- wheat (grass), 

## Root Stucture

1. Root Cap
	- growing point of the root
	- protects region of cell division as the root grows
	- secretes fluid for lubrication
	- contain starch filled amoplasts that helps plant respond to gravity
2. Region of cell division
	- Apical Meristem - creating primary growth - **mitosis**
	- **Procambium** - contained here, turns to xylem and phloem
	- **Ground Meristem** - stores nutrients water
	- **epidermis** - develops from protoderm, becomes outer layer
3. Region of cell elongation
	- cells increase in size, stay in place
4. Region of maturation
	- Root hairs form
	- protoderm - gives rise to epidermis

#### Class Questions

Q. Plants absorb `___` and minerals from the soil through their roots.
A. **Water**

Q. A `___` system is caracterized by single large root with smaller branch roots, wereas `___` root system has many smaller roots of similar diameter?
A. **Taproot, fibrous**

Q. Whats primary role of apical meristem?
A. **Cell division**

Q. Cel in region of `___` are responsible for the growth in length of the roots?
A. **cell elongation**

Q. tissue differentiation occurs:
A. **region of Cell maturation**

## Cross section of Roots

- Dicot Root
	- Epidermis - single cell layer on outside
	- center contains **steel**
		- outside layer of the steel is **endodermis**
			 - directs water through cells and into xylem
			 - regulates the minerals absorbed
		- **Pericycle** - layer between endodermis and xylem/phloam
			- where later roots originate
		- xylem form red X
			- transport water/minerals
			- dead at maturity - dead hollow tubes
		- smaller cells are phloam
			- transport sugars
			- alive
	- Cortex is inbetween
		- storage of minerals water

#### Class Questions

Q. Root cortext is composed of what type of cells?
A. **Parenchyma**

Q. `____` cells produce casparian strips which block movement of water between cells?
- A. **Endodermal**
	- directs water to the xylem
	- casparians are waterproof

## Environments of Roots

- different adaptations of roots based on different environments
	- arid, cold, soil content

- Drought Conditions
	- Roots must:
		- store lots of water
		- Deep root system to find water
		- Example: Wheat
- Food storage roots
	- low nutrients or cold conditions 
	 -Sweet potatoes, yams
	 - organs swell to provide storage of sugars
	 - Parenchyma cells
- Wet Conditions
	- **Pneumatophores** - grow up out of system to grow above water
		- access oxygen
		- Mangroves are an example
- Poor soil conditions
	- Lack of nutrients, hardpacked
	- **Buttress Roots** - grow wide and on surface
		- stabilize plant
- Cold conditions
	- **Contractile Roots** - Pull plants deeper into the soil
		- seen in herbaceous dicots and monocots
		- Lillies are an example
- High Levels of disturbance
	- **Prop roots** - support plants in high wind
		- corn is an example
		- grow from intercalary region above surface
	- Mangroves with bruttresses support plants through tides and storms
- Aerial Roots
	- Orchids
		- obtain nutrients from environment
	- Corn
		- prop roots count
	- Ivies
		- aid in climbing
- Parasitic Roots
	- Plants have no chlorophyll and are dependant on others for nutrition
	- Mistletoe, ghostplant
- Propagative Roots
	- adventitious buds on roots develop into suckers
	- buds draw energy from rest of the plant
		- problem in commercial production
	- can be used to make new plants
- Bug protection
	- Yuka plant
		- bubles/tapioca
		- produce cyanide to deter bugs in the soil

#### Questions

Q. Certain plants (sweet potato) produce roots with extra parenchyyma cells that are full of carbs, theyre called:
A. **Food storage roots**

Q. Whats function of pneumataphoros?
A. **To provide aeration to roots**

## Mycorrihizae

- Mutualistic relationship, sometimes with Fungi
	- both fungus and roots benefit
	- Endo- and Ectomycorrhizae

## Root Nodules

- Allow plants to convert nitrogen
	- Nitrogen-fixing - take nitrogen from the air and convert
	- Legume family
