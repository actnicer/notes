## Monohybrid Cross

- Start with the cross between two true-breeding parents differing for a trait
- Produce F1 generation (all identical)
- **Monohybrid cross**: F1 plants intercrossed to produce F2 generation
    - results:
        - 1:2:1 gen0typic ratio
            - Ex: 1 TT, 2 Tt, 1 tt
        - 3:1 phenotypic ratio (looks)
            - 3 tall, 1 short

## Law of Independant Assortment

- Genes controlling two or more traits segregate independently of each other
- Diffferent pairs of alleles are passed to offspring independently of each other
    - **Unlinked genes**: genes on diffferent chromosomes
    - **Linked genes**: genes on same chromosome
        - Do not segregate independantly

## Dihybrid cross

- Start with parents differing in two traits
- F1 composed of dihybrids
    - produce 4 kinds of gametes
    - Use punnet to determin genotypes of zygotes
    - *Phenotypic ratio* = 9:3:3:1

## Incomplete dominance

- Absense of dominance
    - heterozygote is intermediate in phenotype to the two homozygotes
    - Genotype ratio == phenotype ratio

## Interacitons among Genes

- More than one gene controls phenotype

## Linkage and mapping

- Linked Genes: genes together on a chromosome

## Class Questions

Q. If individual has two of same alleles, then that individual is `___` for that trait:
A. **Homozygous**

Q. Gene desciribed as "Aa", capital letter denotes:
A. **Dominant**

Q. If haploid gametes are produced via meiosis, then what type of gametes can a plant that is Homozygous dominant (GG) produce?
A. **G**

Q. Oftentimes the dominant-recessive relationship between two alleles is because the recesive gene contains a `___`, which makes the encoded protein defective:
A. **mutation**

Q. test cross pea plant to find genotype of the tall plant, following the cross `T? x tt` and the result is that all the offsprring are tall, whats genotype of original tall plant?
A. **TT**

Q. Quantitative traits result in characteristics that are determined by:
A. **Genotype and environment**

Q. Crossing over is more likely to happen between tw genes whose loci are far apart on a chromosome than between two genes whose loci are close together (T or F)
A. **True**
