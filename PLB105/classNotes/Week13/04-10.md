## Crop Plant Evolution

- Artificial selection: Humans select what traits are appealing
- Seed dispersal is the first trait altered during domestication
    - germinate immediately, no need for dormancy
- Center of origin: each crop was first domesticated where its genetic diversity was greatest
    - Ex: Corn = Mexico

## Plant Breeding

- **Plant breeding**: accelerated evolution guided by humans rather than nature
- **Genetic Variation**: foundation for improving plants through breeding
- Take an elite variety, cross breed => aim for specific trait
- Biggest goal: yield
- Borlaug: Deadzone gulf of Mexico

## Germplasm Collection and Gene banks

- Impossible to improve population if there is no genetic variability for a trait
- **Germplasm**: living sum total of a plants genes
- **Gene Bank** established to meet current and future demans of plant genetic diversity
    - Doomsday vaults in Norway
    - [Germplasm Repository Info Network](https://www.ars-grin.gov/Collections)

## Recombinant Technology and Transgenic Plants

- **Transgenic plants**: produced by inseting genes from virtually any organism into plants
- Recombinant DNA

## Genome Editing

- allow scientists to more quickly and accurately edit the DNA of organisms
    - CRISPR is an example

## Application of transgenic plants

- **Agronomic traits**
    - transgenic corn, soybean, cotton and cola verieties have herbicide and insect resistance
- Added nutrition
    - golden rice has genes for beta carotene (vitamin A) synthesis
- Ornamental varieties not seen in nature have been engineered
    - moonshadow carnations have a petunia gene for blue color

## Pros and cons of Transgenic Plants

- Pest populations may develop resistance to pesticides
    - must have one without pesticide to maintain pests without resistance 

# Chp 15 - Evolution

## Intro

- **Natural Selection**: tendancy of organisms with favorable adaptations to their environment to survive and produce new generations
    - Accumulation of genetic changes in populations over time
        - changes in allele frequency

## Evidence of Evolution

- **Homologous structure**: characteristics shared by organisms with common ancestry
- **Analagous strucutre**: a similar characterstic shared by organisms with different ancestry
- can look to:
    - Fossil records
    - gene records
- Convergent evolution
    - Simularities not due to common ancestry, similar selection pressure
    - cacti formed in different parts of world
- Divergent evolution
    - differences arising from common ancestral structures through differnt selection pressures
- **Adaptation**: characteristic that makes an organism better suited to its environment

## Class questions

- Which were traits selected for domestication
    - Large seeds
    - quick germination
    - Seed retention

Q. A transgenic plant can only be made with genes from other plants (T or F):
A. False
- ex: BT-corn

Q. The movement of DNA from one organism, usually via a plasmid, into another organism is called:
A. **transformation**

Q. Name a benefit of transgenic crops
A. may produce higher vitamin content
- Negatives:
    - May hybridize with weedy relatives
    - may cause allergies
    - often owned by large multinational companies
