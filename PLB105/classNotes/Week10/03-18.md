## Photosynthesis

- Phases of Photosynthesis
    - Light dependant
        - take place in **thylakoids**
        - Two Photosystems (I & II) work simultaneously to carry out reactions
            - photosystem II events happen first
        - Water molecules split apart, release electrons and H ions
        - oxygen gas is released
        - ATP is produced from ADP in the electron transport chain
            - grinds through like turnstile, creating energy
        - NADP is reduced forming NADPH, passed onto light independant reaction in the electron transport chain 
        - Chemiosis
            - Electrons passed along between electon acceptor molecules in thylakoid membrane
            - Protons (H+) accumulate in thylakoid lume 
            - Creates **Proton Gradient**
                - More H+ inside thylakoid than outside
                - **Phosphorylation** - ATP is formed from ADP using gradient
            - protons move across membrane = main source of energy for ATP
    - Light independant reactions/ carbon fixation/ calvin cycle
        - take place outside thylakoid in the **stroma** of chloroplasts
        - **Calvin Cycle**
            - Energy furnished from ATP and NADPH produced during light-dependant reactions
            1. Carbon Fixation
                - Generates C3 atom
            2. Reduction
                - C3 is reduced, electrons added
            3. RuBP Regeneration

## Photorespiration

- Occurs in hot/dry conditions
- Plant closes stomata
    - doesn't lose water
    - but no CO2 can enter
- Rubisco fixes O2 instead of CO2
    - Small amount of CO2 can enter Calvin Cycle like normal

- If light intensity too high
    - photo-oxidation which results in destruction of chlorophyll
- If water in short sully or light intensity too high
    - stomata clase and reduce supply of co2 for photosynth

## Photosynthesis Variations

- C3
    - limited in high light conditiosn
    - as temp increases, photosynth decreases
- C4
    - photosynthesis more under greater light intensities
    - as temp increases, photosynth level remains constant (produces the same) 
    - lower photosynth level than c3 at lower temps

- C4 
    - 4 carbon pathway
    - 4 carbon compound
    - Plants have **Kranz Anatomy**
        - undifferentiated mesophyll cells
        - Photosyntheic bundle sheath cells
            - Calvin cycle takes place here
- C3 
    - 3 carbon PGA during initial steps of light-independent reactions
    - Calvin cycle takes place in Mesophyll
    - bundle sheath is non-photosynthetic
- CAM
    - Crassulacean Acid Metabolism
    - Cacti, stonecrop, orchids and succulents, pineapple
    - Stomata open at night
        - take in Co2 and store as 4C organic acid in vacuole
    - convert back to CO2 during day for use in Calvin Cycle

## Class Questions 

Q. High o2/low co2 and/or hot/dry climates promote `___` in photosynthetic plants?
A. **Photorespiration**

Q. Characteristics of c4 plants:
- **A. Photosynth. bundle sheath cycle**
- **A. undifferentiated mesophyll cell**
- **A. fixes CO2 as a 4 carbon coumpound intially**

Q. How do CAM plants avoid water loss
A. **close their stomata during the day and open them at night**

Q. When photon absorbed in chlorophyll the energy level of some of the electrons in the pigment is raised, whats possible after that:
- **The absorbed energy can eventually be stored in chem bonds**
    - Stored in NADPH (chemical bonds)
- **Energy released as heat**
    - energy lost as its passed along electron transport chain
- **Pigment can fluoresce or phosphoresce**
