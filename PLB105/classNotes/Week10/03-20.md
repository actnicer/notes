## Respiration

- Steps
    - Glycolysis
        - Glucose is broken down
        - happens in cytoplasm
    - Citric acid (Krebs) Cycle
        - Produces NADH, FADH2 and small amount of ATP
        - CO2 produced as byproduct
        - Occurs in *cristae* of *mitochondria*
    - Electron Transport
        - Inner membrane of mitochondria
        - NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to electron transport system
        - produce **ATP**, CO2 and H20
- Rate of Respiration
    - Temperature, water, oxygen

# Chp. 11 - Growth and Development

- **Growth** - Irreversable increase in mass due to division and enlargment of cells
    - **Determinate** - plant grows, stops, and dies in one season
    - **Indeterminate** - Plant or parts of plant grow and continue to be active for several/many years
    - growth and development determined by environment and genes
- **Differentiation** - Cells develop different forms adapted to specific functs

## Internal Requirements

- Nutrients
    - obtained from air and soil
- Vitamins
    - synthesized in cell membranes and cytoplasm
- Hormones
    - dictated by genes
    - Same hormone can have different effects based on concentration

## Five Classes of Plant Hormones

- **Auxins**
    - Discovered by Fritz Went w/ coleoptile expirement
    - Produced in apical meristems (tips)
    - Promote cell enlargment and cell growth, cell division in cambium, and initiation of roots
    - used t odelay leaf abscission and fruit ripening
- **Gibberellins** (GA)
    - Discovered in 1926
    - Most dicots and some monocots grow faster when this is applied
    - Involved in same regulation process as auxins
    - Stem elongation, flowering and seed germination
- Cytokinins
    - hormones that promote cell divisions
    - Trigger mitosis
    - Synthesized in root tips and germinating seeds
    - aid:
        - Enlargment of cells
        - differentiation of tissues
        - dev of chloroplasts
        - delay aging of leaves
- Abscisic acid
- Ethylene
    - mediates abscission in plants

## Class questions

Q. which statements are true for photorespiration *and* photosynthesis
A. Occur in chloroplasts, require light

Q. Which factors can effect the rate of photosytnhesis 
- A. **Light intensity, temperature, chlorophyll concentration, water availability**
    - the more chlorophylls, the more photosynth that can happen

Q. What best describes cellular respiration:
A. A means to extract energy from organic molecules (carbohydrates)

Q. During which phase of respiration are most of the ATP generated?
A. **Electon Transport**

Q. Where are auxins primarilary produced?
A. **Apical Meristems**
