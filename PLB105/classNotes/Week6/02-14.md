## Specialized Leaves

- Shade leaves
    - receive less sunlight than sun leaves
    - larger, thinner
    - fewer defined mesophyll layers and fewer chloroplasts
    - fewer hairs
        - hairs = modified leaves
        - limit sunlight received by leaf
- Leaves of Arid Regions
    - Thick leathery leaves
    - fewer/sunken stomata
    - succulent, water reatining leaves
    - dense, hairy coverings to limit sunlight
    - aloe, stone plant, compass plant
- Leaves of Aquatic Areas
    - Transpiration is not necessary
    - mesophyll not differentiated into palisade and spongy layers
    - large air spaces to keep them afloat
    - stomata always on upper leaf surface
        - dont need to worry about losing water
        - still needed for gas exchange
- Storage Leaves
    - succulent leaves modified for water storage
    - have parenchyma cells with large vacuoles
    - fleshy leaves store carbs
    - onions, lily
- Flower-pot Leaves
    - plant creates own pot, symbiosis with ants
        - become home for ant colonies
    - ants bring in dirt, dirt is fertilized by plant
    - plant doesnt need to grow into ground
- Window leaves & Reproductive leaves
    - Window
        - buried up to surface
        - top layer is transluscent 
        - sun can shine through plant, photosythesis happens everywhere
    - Reproductive
        - New plants at leaf tips (walking), plantlets at margins (air)
        - walking fern, air plant
        - asexual reproduction, no recombination
- Floral Leaves (Bracts)
    - Poinsettia, Clarys Sage
    - at bases of flowers
    - brightly colored leaves to attract pollinators (reproduction)
- Insect-Trapping Leaves
    - Grow in swampy areas and bogs
    - Nitrogen deficiencies in soil
        - need to supplement elsewhere
    - Leaves trap and digest insects
        - venus flytrap
            - size of hairs determine whether target is worth energy expense
    - pitcher, sundews, venus flytrap, bladderwort


#### Tendrils and Spines

- Spines
    - Modified leaves that reduce leaf surface
    - protect from herbivores
    - cacti
- Tendrils
    - curl around rigitd objects
    - helps them climb, provides support
    - garden peas
- Spines vs Thorns vs Prickles
    - spines = modified leaves, grow below axillary bud (below leaf)
    - thorn = grow above axillary bud (above leave), modified stems
    - Prickles = outgrowth from epidermis, rose "thorns" are example



## Class Questions

Q. Primary function of leaves is:
A. Food production (photosynthesis)

Q. This ecosystem service contributes to water filtration by releasing water vapor into environment:
- A. **Transpiration**

Q. Venation patterns for monocot and dicots are:
A. Different

Q. these are adaptations of leaves to an arid environment:
- A. Sunken stomata, dense hairy covering
    - stomata sunken (off surface) provides barrier to environment, reduce evaporation/water loss

Q. Which prickly structure are modified leaves in cacti and other desert plants?
A. **Spines**

Q. Brightly colored leaves that surround an inconspicuous true flower are called:
A. **Bracts**

# Chp 8 - Flowers, Fruits, and Seeds

- Flowers 
    - Method of reproduction
    - **Angiosperms** - plants that produce flowers
    - 11 species provide 80% of the worlds food

## Plant life histories

- Annual
    - life cycle completed in one season
- Biennial
    - cycle completed in two growing seasons
    - celery, carrots 
        - harvested in first year, produce flowers in second year
- Perennial
    - cycle take many growing seasons

## Flowering Plant Classes

- Monocots
    - seeds = one cotyledon
    - flower parts in multiples of 3
    - venetian = parallel
    - bundles are scattered
    - usually fibrous roots
- Dicots
    - seeds = two cotyledon
    - flower parts in multiples of four or five
    - venetian = network of veins
    - only one with vascular and cork cambiums
    - bundles in a string
    - usually taproot

## Structure of Flowers

- Receptacle
    - swollen end of peduncle of pedicle
- Parts attached to receptacle are **Whorls**
    - **sepals**
        - outermost whorl
        - collectively called **calyx**
    - **petals**
        - collectively called **corolla**
        - showy corolla attract pollinators
    - **stamens**
        - Attached to base of pistil
        - consist of filament with anther at top
    - **pistil**
        - innermost whorl
        - consist of:
            - **stigma**
            - **style**
            - **ovary**
                - develop into fruit

## Class Question

Q. Which is are characteristic of Monocot?
A. Floral parts in 3's
