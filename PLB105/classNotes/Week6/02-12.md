# Chp. 7 - Leaves

[class slides](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/1856668/viewContent/15579058/View?ou=1856668)

## Leaf Functions

- main purpose (function) = photosynthesis
    - stomata
        - CO2 in and O2 out
        - allow water vapor to escape
        - other functions: waste disposal, moving water

## Leaf Morphology

- originate as **primordia buds**
- At maturity leaves have:
    - **petiole** / stalk
    - Flat **blade**
        - where light absorption happens
    - **Veins** - vascular bundles
    - **Stipules** - at base of petiole
- grow directly from stem
    - occasionally below axillary bud (enclose meristematic tissues)

## Simple vs. Compound Leaves

- Simple
    - Leaves with a single blade
- Compound
    - blade divided into **leaflets**

#### Arrangements and Types

- Vary in size
    - Duckweed = 1mm 
    - Giant water lilly = 2 meters diameter

- Arrangement (phyllotaxy)
    - Alternate
        - One leaf per node
    - Opposite
        - two leaves per node
    - Whorled
        - three or more leaves per node

## Leaf Venation

- Venation - Arrangement of veins in leaf
    - **Pinnately**
        - one main midvien
    - **Palmately** veined
        - several primary veins
- Monocots vs. Dicots
    - Dicots - **netted** venation
        - divergent in various ways
    - Monocots - **Parallel** venation
        - bundles all aligned (vertical or horizontal)

## Internal Structure of Leaves

- Epidermis
    - layer of cells covering entire surface of leaf
    - translucent except for stomata 
        - stomata contain chloroplasts
    - waxy lipid coating (cuticle)
    - may have trichomes (fuzzy surface)
        - secrete waxy substances for protection, animal deterent
    - Stomata
        - found on lower epidermis (underneath leaf)
        - openings on bottom to regulate water transpiration
        - also regulate gas exchange in and out
            - potassium is pulled into guard cells 
            - close when no sun because no photosynthesis happening
        - Two guard cells around opening
- Mesophyll
    - parenchyma cells where photosynthesis takes place
    - between epidermis layers
    - **Palisade Mesophyll**
        - barrel shaped parenchmya cells 
        - contain most of leafs chloroplasts
        - top layer of leaf, more photosynthesis here
    - **Spongy mesophlyll**
        - loose parenchyma cells, abundant air spaces
        - bottom layer of leaf
- Veins (vascular bundles)
    - scattered throughout the mesophyll
    - xylem on top, phloam on bottom
        - surrounded by **bundle sheath** - thicker wall of parenchyma

#### Monocot Mesophyll/Veins

- Usually dont have mesophyll
- Have **buliform cells**
    - collapse in dry conditions
    - cause leaf to fold to reduce transpiration

## Autumnal Changes in Leaf Color

- Chloroplasts contain several groups of pigments
    - Chlorophylls (green)
    - Carotenoids (yellow)
    - in fall chlorophylls break down, revealing other colors
    - Anthocyonins (red/blue) Betacyanins (red) 
        - may be present in vacuole
- **Abscission** - process of shedding leaves
    - forms protective layer so nutrients arent lost
    - plant absorbs all nutrients that it can and then seals off petiole
        - called **abscission zone**
    - forms seperation layer
        - pectins of cells are broken down by enzymes

## Human and Ecological Relevance

## Class Question

Q. Whats the flattened portion of a leaf called?
A. **Blade**

Q. Plants are able to capture `___` from the sun and store it as sugars:
A. **Energy**

Q. Which description represents when three or more leafs are attached at a node?
A. **whorled**

Q. In contrast to dicot leaves, monocot leaves have `___` venation:
A. **Parallel**

Q. Stomata allow carbon dioxide into the leaf while allowing `___` vapor to exit the leaf:
A. **Water vapor**

Q. Plant vein cells (xylem/phloem) surrounded by what:
A. **Bundle sheath cells**

Q. which is not a cause of leaf color change?
- A. **because anthocyanin break down** - produced at this time not broken down
    - real reasons: change in temp/day length, chlorophyll breakdown, other pigments visivble

Q. process that allows deciduous trees to shed their leaves in the fall?
A. **Abscission**
