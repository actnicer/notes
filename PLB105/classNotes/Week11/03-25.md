## Five Classes of Plant Hormones

- **Auxins**
    - Discovered by Fritz Went w/ coleoptile expirement
    - Produced in apical meristems (tips)
    - Promote cell enlargment and cell growth, cell division in cambium, and initiation of roots
    - used to delay leaf abscission and fruit ripening
    - used in phototropism (accumulate on other side of plant)
- **Gibberellins** (GA)
    - Discovered in 1926
    - Most dicots and some monocots grow faster when this is applied
    - Involved in same regulation process as auxins
    - Stem elongation, flowering and seed germination
- **Cytokinins**
    - hormones that promote cell divisions
    - Trigger mitosis
    - Synthesized in root tips and germinating seeds
    - aid:
        - Enlargment of cells
        - differentiation of tissues
        - dev of chloroplasts
        - delay aging of leaves
- **Abscisic acid (ABA)**
    - Inhibatory effect on stimulatory effect of other hormones
    - commonly in fleshy fruits
    - helps leaves respond to excessive water loss
        - interfere with retention of potassium ions on guard cells
        - causes stomata to close
- **Ethylene**
    - gas that can promote action on other plants
    - mediates/accelerates abscission in plants
    - Ex: Protection method like the acacias from the giraffes
- Oligosaccharins
- Brassinosteroids

## Hormonal Interactions

- Apical dominance
    - suppression of growth of lateral (axillary) buds
    - **Auxin** is an inhibitor in terminal buds
    - Strong in trees with conical shape
        - Pines spruces firs
    - weak in trees that branch more often
        - Elms, ashes, willows
    - If **cytokinins** applied in appropriate concentration to axillary buds:
        - plants will begin to grow
        - even in precence of terminal bud
- **Senescence**
    - breakdown of cell components and membranes
    - eventually leads to death of the cell
    - Leaves of decidious trees and shrubs drop via *abscission*
- **Abscission**
    - Leaves are shed
    - Occurs in abscission zone
    - Leaves coated in **suberin** on outer protective layer
    - Pectins in middle lamela of cells are broken down by cells in **Seperation layer**
    - Triggered by short days and cold nights 
- Other
    - Root and shoot development in tissue culture
        - regulated by auxins and cytokinins
    - Seed germination
        - regulated by gibberellins and ABA

## Plant Movements (Tropisms)

- Result in varying growth rates in diff parts of an organ
- **Tropism**
    - Permanent movement resulting from external stimul
- **Phototropism**
    - Growth movement away from or toward light
    - Positive
        - toward light
        - shoots
    - Negative 
        - Away from light 
        - Roots eithe insensitive or negatively phototrophic
    - Auxin migrates away from light and accumulate on other side
        - promot greater elongation on the dark side
- **Gravitropism**
    - Growth responses to stimulus of gravity
    - Primary roots, positively gravitropic
    - Shoots - negatively gravit
    - Graviy perceived by amyloplasts in the root cap
        - proteins outside of the plasma membrane
        - Lets the plant perceive which was is down
- **Thigmotropism**
    - contact with a solid object
        - Twining
        - Cells on contact side become shorter and cells on opposite side become elongated
    - Help plants to support themselves

## Turgor Movements

- Turgor Movements
    - Result in changes in internal water pressures and often initiated by contact with objects outside the plant
    - Temporary movement
    - Sensitivity plant, venus fly trap
    - Leaves move by **pulvini**
        - special swellings at bease of leaf
    - Can take place in flowers as well as leaves

## Sleep movements

- Circadian Rythyms
    - Plants can detect light cycles
- regular daily cycles
    - leaves or petals fold on daily cycles
- Partially involved in light and temp detections

## Photoperiodism

- Photoperiodism: Length of day (night) directly related to the onset of flowering
    - Short day plants: 
        - flower will not flower unless day length is shorter than a critical period
            - asters, poinsettas, ragweed, osrgums, strawberries
    - Long Day plants:
        - Will not flower unless periods of light are longer than a critical period
        - Annuals or summer plants, beets, larkspur, lettuce, potatoes, spinach, wheat
- Vegitative activites affected by Phototropisms
    - Dormancy of buds
    - Germination of seeds

## Phytochromes

- Phytochromes
    - Pigment that controls photoperiodism
        - Mostly meristematic tissue
    - Two forms
        - Pr - absorb red light
        - Pfr - absorbs far red light
    - Response to Phytochrome
        - flowering
        - plant dev
        - changes in plastids
        - production of ant
