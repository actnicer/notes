## Photosynthesis

- Inputs
    - Light: visible light
        - green parts of light are not absorbed but are reflected
        - **Chlorophyll**: absorbs visible light to convert to energy
            - Take in energy and is used up as heat
        - **Photosystem**: light harvesting unit
            - passes along electron transport chain
    - Water: less than 1% of water taken in by plants is used for Photsynth
        - in either drought or if light is too intense: stomata close and reduce supply of CO2
    - Carbon Dioxide
        - reaches chloroplasts in mesophyll cells by diffusing through stomata into lead interior
        - only used in *independant* reactions (calvin cycle)
        - enters through the stomata
        - O2 released before CO2

- Energy Transfer/REDOX
    - Photosynth cycle involves transfer of energy via oxidation-reduction reaction
    - **OIL RIG**: Oxidation is loss / Reduction is gain
        - oxidized molecules lose electrons, reduction molecules gain molecules

- Phases of Photosynthesis
    - Light dependant
        - take place in **thylakoids**
        - Two Photosystems (I & II) work simultaneously to carry out reactions
            - photosystem II events happen first
        - Water molecules split apart, release electrons and H ions
        - oxygen gas is released
        - ATP is produced from ADP in the electron transport chain
        - NADP is reduced forming NADPH, passed onto light independant reaction in the electron transport chain 
        - Chemiosis
            - Electrons passed along between electon acceptor molecules in thylakoid membrane
            - Protons (H+) accumulate in thylakoid lume 
            - Creates **Proton Gradient**
                - More H+ inside thylakoid than outside
                - **Phosphorylation** - ATP is formed from ADP using gradient
            - protons move across membrane = main source of energy for ATP

- Phases of Photosynthesis
    - Light independant reactions/ carbon fixation/ calvin cycle
        - take place outside thylakoid in the **stroma** of chloroplasts
    - Calvin Cycle
        - Energy furnished from ATP and NADPH produced during light-dependant reactions
        1. Carbon Fixation
        2. Reduction
        3. RuBP Regenation

- NADPH
- NADP+
- Calvin Cycle
    - fixes carbon using energy from NADPH and NADP reactions



## Class Questions

Q. For photosynth to proceed, green plants require CO2, `___` and light energy to produce sugars
A. **Water**

Q. Oxygen produced by plants comes from the splitting of `___` molecules?
A. **Water**

Q. What occures during oxidation-reduction reaction?
A. **when a Atom or molecule is oxidized an electron is removed and transfered to another molecule, thereby reduced**

Q. During light dependant reaction, water molecules split, oxygen gas released, ATP created. one other thing, what is it?
A. **NADPH**

Q. Both photosystems, light is absorbed by chlorophyll reaction center, which photosystem is water split to create O gas?
A. **Photosystem II**

Q. Electron transport chains shuttle electrons through the thylakoid membrane setting up proton gradient, what is generated as proteins move back through the membrane?
A. **ATP**

Q. Photophosphorlation (using light energy to add a phosphate group) produces `___`, which stores chem energy thst can be used for Calvin Cycle. Carbon Fix. also requires reducing power provided by `___` produced by photosystem I
A. **ATP, NADPH**
