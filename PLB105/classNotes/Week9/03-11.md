# Chp 9 - Water in Plants

## Transport of Food (Organic Solutes)

- Pressure flow hypothesis
    - organic solutes flow from source where water enters by osmosi, to sinks, where food is utilized and water exits
        - made wherever there are photosynthetic cells
        - pulled to wherever there are sink cells
        - used (for ex) by apical meristems
    - **Phloam Loading** - dumping sugars into phloam
    - Process
        - Sugars created at source cells
        - carried by active transport (ATP) to phloam
        - increases sugar conc. in phloam, water in xylem carries it over and increases turgor pressure
            - turgor pressure develops and drives fluids through sieve tubes toward sinks

## Mineral Requirements for Growth

- Essential Elements
    - CHOPKNSCaFeMgNaClCuMnCoZnMoB

- Macronutrients
    - NPCaPhMgS
    - Used in greater amounts
- Micronutrients
    - INaClCuMnCoZnMbB
    - needed in small amounts
- Nutrients available in the soil
- Soil pH affect what nutrients in the soil
- Nitrogen
    - needed for photosynthesis, water movement
    - if difficient, leaves turn yellow
        - starts from bottom and works upward
- Phosphoros
    - with difficency: stunted veins
    - Involved in ATP (generation of ATP molecules), involved in blooming and fruiting
- Potassium
    - Essential for stomata function

# Chp 10 - Plant Metabolism

## Intro

- **Metabolism** - Sum of all interrelated biochemical processes in living organisms
    - **Photosynthesis** - converts light energy to a usable form
        - results in sugars
        - requires the sun, H20 and CO2
        - occurs in the chloroplast
        - Inputs:
            - Slide 23
    - **Respiration** - how the stored energy is used, facilitate growth and reproduction

## Photosynthesis

![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-03-11 111750.png>)

- Inputs:
    - Light
        - 40% of radiant energy received on earth in form of visible light
        - different colors = different wavelenghts
        - shorter wavelengths = greater amounts of energy
        - Chlorophyll: green pigment molecule present in all green plants and cyanobacteria
            - different pigments allow photosynthesis over broader light spectrum
        - Many pigments together = **photosystem**


## Class Questions

Q. What do we call the movement of molecules from region of higher concentration to lower concentration?
A. **Diffusion**

Q. Which describes a semipermiable membrane
A. **Different substances pass through membrane at different rates**

Q. In pathway of water moving through plant what happens first?
- A. Water enters roots through stem via osmosis
    - transported up through stem and into the leaves through xylem
    - water crosses semipermiable membrane at endodermis as enters central root system of plant
    - Water evaporates through leaves through stomata

- Adhesion - binding of water to other things

Q. Which cells control when stomata are opened or closed?
A. **Guard cells**

Q. During photosynthesis what happens in guard cells that bring change in water potential?
A. **Cells expend energy to get potassium from epidermal cells, lowers water potential and increases turgor pressure**

Q. Which is not needed for pressure flow hypothesis?
- A. Cells that will squeeze the phloam and push dissolved food from place to place
    - do need: concentration gradiend between source (high conc.) and sink (low conc.)

Q. In addition to C and O2 plants get from CO2 and H2 they get from H2O, where do other minerals needed for growth come from?
A. **Soil**

Q. Which of following statements correctly states a difference bretween macronutrients and micronutrients 
A. 

Q. If plants leaves are yellow and plant not growing or producing fruit, what mineral is involved?
A. **Nitrogen**

Q. If plant stomata not openning properly under sunlight and moderate temp conditions, what mineral is involved?
A. **Potassium**

Q. If plant stomata not openning properly under sunlight and moderate temp conditions, what processes could be comprimised?
A. **Transpiration, Photosynthesis**

Q. First step in photosynthesis is that `__` must absorb light energy from the sun:
A. **Chlorophyll**

Q. Which wavelengths does chlorophyll B absorb most strongly? From graph on slide 25
A. 470 nm
