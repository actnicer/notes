# Chp 15 - Evolution

## Microevolution - Evolution with species

- Darwins Observations:
    - **Artificial selection**: changes in population of domestic animals by retaining animals with desirable traits
    - Limited supply of food and other resources prevents some individuals from reproducing
- Natural selection -> descent with modification

- Darwin did not explain how hereditary variations originated
    - we now know it was through mutation

## Four Principles of Evolution

1. Overproduction of offspring
2. Struggle for existence - competition for resources
3. Inheritance and accumulation of favorable variations
4. Survival and reproduction of the fittest

## Mutation 

- **Mutation**: change in a gene or chromosome
    - mostly harmful
    - **deletion**: part of a chromosome breaks off
    - **translocation**: piece of chromosome becomes attached to another
    - **inversion**: part of chromosome breaks off and then reattaches in an inverted position
- Migration: gene flow between populations when individuals or gametes migrate from one population or another
- Genetic Drift: changes in genetic maku-up due to random event
    - Ex: wildfire

## Macroevolution: how species evolve

- Populations separated by barriers they become different over time
- Pre-zygotic barriers
    - geographic
        - isolation of two populations prevents gene flow
    - ecological
        - species in the same area but dont reproduce because of one thing that keeps them seperated
        - ex: black sage and white sage exist in same location but dont exchange genes bc they flower @ different times of the year
    - mechanical
        - ex: orchids need very specific conditions to occur, garauntee that they'll only fit together if they're the same species
- Post-zygotic barriers
    - Zygote death
    - sterility of hybrids

## Role of Polyploidy in Evolution

- **Polploidy**: occurance of double the normal chromosome number
    - occurs when:
        - failure of meiosis to halve chromosome number in gametes
        - spontaneous chromosome doubling
    - Not tolerated in animals because animals have dosage dependant regualation of gene expression

## Hybridization 

- Hybrids: offspring produced by interspecific (diff species) cross
    - often sterile
- autoploidy

# Chapter 20: Plant Kingdom

- In order for plant to be functional on land needed to be **able to retain water**
- developments that made this possible waS:
    - cuticle: waxy layer for water retention
    - multicellular gametangla and sporangla
    - Mulicellular embryos in the parantel tissue

## Phylum Bryphyta

- Mosses
    - Dominant generation: haploid
    - outer waxy cuticles prevent water loss
    - root like rhizoids anchor the plant
    - spores germinate: release to the wind to spread
    - non-vascular: water absorbed directly through the surface (osmosis)
- Later led to development of fern type plants

## Class questions

Q. a scenario where one hundred acorns germinate but only five receive sufficient sunlight ot survive and rest die exemplify what principle of natural selection?
- A. **Struggle for existence**
    - Acorns compete for resource

Q. a `___` is a type of mutation that is the result of a part of a chromosome breaking off and becoming lost:
A. **deletion**

Q. Movement of alleles through gametes or individuals from one population to another is called:
A. **gene flow**

Q. What type of isolation is defined by 2 populations that although symatic do not interbreed due to reproductive isolation or some other nutritive difference? 
A. **ecological drift**

Q. Describe allopolyploid:
A. A polyploid generated from an interspecific cross

Q. The adaptation of plants to a terrestrial environment required:
A. adaptations that kept them from drying out
