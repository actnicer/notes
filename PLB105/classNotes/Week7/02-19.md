## Monocots and Dicots

## Structure of Flowers

- Receptacle
    - swollen end of peduncle of pedicle
- Parts attached to receptacle are **Whorls**
    - **sepals**
        - outermost whorl
        - collectively called **calyx**
        - modified leaves
    - **petals**
        - collectively called **corolla**
        - showy corolla attract pollinators
    - **stamens**
        - Attached to base of pistil
        - consist of filament with anther at top
    - **pistil**
        - innermost whorl
        - consist of:
            - **stigma**
            - **style**
            - **ovary**
                - develop into fruit

## Flowers

- Complete 
    - has calyx, corolla, stamens and pistil
- incomplete
    - at least one part is missing
    - missing any whorls
- Perfect
    - both stamens and pistil
        - has whorl 3 and whorl 4
- Imperfect
    - either stamens or pistil missing
    - **Monoecious species** - male and female imperfects on same plant
        - zucchini, begonia, mango, cucumber
            - begonia - doesnt produce either, can be propagated or planted with a bulb
    - **Dioecious species**
        - plant bears only male flowers and other plants bear only female flowers
            - papaya, asparagus, hemp, hop, kiwifruit, currant
- cannot be imperfect and incomplete
    - can be perfect and incomplete
        - perfect just pays attention to reproductive parts

### Ovaries

- Ovary
    - contain ovules within carpels
    - **ovules** - develop into seeds after fertilization
    - **carpel** - ovule bearing cavity
    - pistil can consist of one to several carpels
- position
    - **Superior ovary**
        - ovary produced on top of receptical
    - **Inferior ovary**
        - receptacle or other flower parts fused to ovary and grown up around it 

### Primitive flowering plants

- Magnolia is an example
- simple leaves
- superior ovary
- radially semetrical
    - symmetrical in many directions

### Specialized Flowering Plants

- orchids are an example
    - monocots - parallel veins 
- inferior ovary
- bilarterally symmetrical
    - symmetrical in one direction

### Infloresence

- The arrangement of flowers on a plant
- flowers can be produced singly or in groups

### Purpose of Flowers

- Flowers ar ethe mechanism for reproduction in Angiosperms
- all flowers have same purpose: *to facilitati reproduction and produce offspring*
- happens via:
    - **Pollination** - transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma
        - self polination
        - polination by insects, wind, water, animals or gravity
        - vs **Ferilization** - Union of sperm and egg
    - **Double fertilization** - sperm unites with egg, forms zygote and then embryo
        - Sperm unites wit central cell nuclei, produce **triploid**
        - ovule becomes seed, ovary matures into fruit, intrguments harden into seed coat
        - Endosperm tissue - nutritive tissue for embryo 
            - part of the popcorn that pops

## Seeds

- Ovules develop into seeds
    - **cotyledons** - food storage organs that function as "seed leaves"
        - one per seed
    - **Embryo** - cotyledons and plantlet

### Germination

- **Germination** - Beginning or resumption of seed growth
- Factors that must be met for germination
    - internal factors:
        - Embryo maturity
        - presence or absense of chemical inhibitors
    - external factors:
        - water and oxygen 
            - enzymes in cytoplasm begin to function after water is imbibed
        - Light (or absence of light)
            - without light it knows to wait
            - indicates when to germinate
        - Proper temp range
    - important so that seed doesn't germinate premeturely

### Seed Dormancy

- Some seeds require period of dormancy
- **Scarification** - artificially breaking dormancy

### Seed Longivity

- WJ Beal
    - longest continuous experiment in the world
