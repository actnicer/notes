[class slides](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/1856668/viewContent/15603837/View?ou=1856668)

## Flowers 

#### Stamens and Pistils

- whorls:
    - sepals (calyx)
        - protect the bud
    - Petals (corolla)
    - stamen
        - Produce pollen grains (reproductive structures)
        - filament capped by anther
    - pistil
        - female structure (ovaries/ovules contained within)
        - style capped by stigma (sticky)

- Monocots
    - parallel veins
    - number of petals multiple of 3

## Seeds

- Dicot
- Monocot

#### Germination

#### Seed Dormancy

- Some seeds require period of dormancy
- **Scarification** - artificially breaking dormancy
- Dormancy can be broken
    - mechanical abrasion
    - thawing/freezing
    - rains
    - bacterial action

## Fruit 

- Fruit - **Contain seeds**
    - pinecones contain seeds but are not fruits (no flowers/ovaries)

#### Fruit Terminology

- Pericarp:
    - **Exocarp** - skin
    - **Endocarp** - inner boundary around seed
    - **Mesocarp** - tissue between exo/endocarp

#### Kinds of Fruits

- *Fleshy Fruits*
    - Mesocarp is fleshy at maturity
    - develop from single pistil
    - **Berries**
        - anything that comes from compound ovary => (chambers > 1)
        - fleshy pericarp
        - **True berry** - thin skin and soft pericarp
            - tomato, grapes, peppers, blueberries, banana, pepper
                - bananas are clones (sterile)
        - **Pepo** - relatively thick rind
            - tougher exocarp than true berries
            - pumpkin, cucumber, watermelon
        - **Hesperidium** - berry with a leathery skin containing oils
            - citrus fruits (orange)
            - pith = white under peel
    - **Drupes**
        - simple fleshy fruit with single seed enclosed by hard stony endocarp (pit)
        - peaches, almonds, olives, cherries
        - endocarp (pit) is sclerenchyma tissue
    - **Pomes**
        - flesh comes in englarges floral tube/receptacle that grows around ovary
        - endocarp papery/leathery
        - apples, pears
- *Aggregate Fruits*
    - multiple pistils (ovaries) with one flower
    - Strawberry (also accessory fruit), rasperries, blackberries
- *Multiple Fruits*
    - multiple flowers each with one fruit (inflorenscence)
    - mulberries, osage orange, pineapple, figs

Q. Which of the following is botanically classified as a vegetable? 
- A. **None of above - vegetable is not a botanical term**
    - tomato = fruit
    - lettuce = leaf
