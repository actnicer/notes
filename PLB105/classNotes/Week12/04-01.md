## Mitosis

- Mitosis: asexual reproduction
    - covered previous class

## Meiosis

- Meiosis
    - Sexual Reproduction
        - Gametes produced
            - egg and sperm unite to form zygote
    - Steps:
        - Prophase I: Parent cell
        - 1st Meiotic division

- Meiosis
    - Create daughter cells that are genetically equal
    - Goes from diploid to haploid
- Chromosomes and meiosis
    - Cells have two sets of chromosomes
        - one set from each parent
        - members of each pair are identical in
            - Length
            - amnt of dna
            - genes carried
            - locations in centromere
    - Results of meiosis:
        - four cells from two successive divisions

#### Phases of meiosis

- Before meiosis
    - DNA Duplicates
        - each chromosome has identical dna molecules held together by centromere
- Division I
    - Number of chromosomes reduced in half
    - Prophase I
        - 'Pro' = before ie happens first
        - Chromosomes coil and condense
        - Homologous chromosomes pair
            - different from mitosis - line up together and cross over
            - exchange genetic material
        - Nuclear envelope dissociates
        - Genetical material is recombined in different ways
            - why siblings dont always look identical
    - Metaphase I
        - 'Meta' = middle
        - chromosomes align in pairs in the middle
    - Anaphase I
        - One whole chromosome from each pair migrates to the pole
        - 'a' for away
    - Telophase I
        - Original cell becomes two cells or two nuclei
        - 'T' for two
- Division II
    - No further reduction of chromosomes in number
    - Prophase II
        - Similar to I
        - chromosomes become shorter and thicker
    - Metaphase II
        - Centromeres aligned along equator
        - new spindles completed
    - Anaphase II
        - Centromeres and chromatids of each chromosome seperate and migrate to opposite poles
    - Telophase II
        - coils of chromatids relax and chromosomes become longer/thinner
        - nuclear and nucloli reappear for each group of chromosomes
        - new cell walls form

#### Mitosis vs. Meiosis

## Alteration of Generations

- Meiosis results in half the number of sets in a gamete compared to parent cell
- **Haploid** (1x)
    - Cell with one set of chromosomes
        - gamets
- **Diploid** (2x)
    - Cell with two sets of chromosomes
        - zygote
        
- Alternation of generations
    - Sporophyte phase
        - diploid
    - Gametophyte phase
        - haploid
        - develop from spores
        - fertilization produces zygot
            - fusion of gametes

# Chp. 13 - Intro to Genetics and Molecular Biology Pt. 1

## DNA Structures

- Chromosomes composed two types of large molecules
    - DNA and Protein
- **DNA**
    - Chain of nucleotides:
        - Nitrogenous base
        - 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose)
        - Phosphate group
    - Double helix
        - nucleotides bonded together
    - Sugar-phosphate backbone
        - sides composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups
    - Four types of DNA nucleotides each wit hunique nitrogenous bases
        - Two purines
            - adenine (A) and Guanine (G)
        - Two primidines
            - Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T)
        - Purines (AG) pair with pyrimidines (TC)
        - `G-C` or `A-T`

## DNA Functions

- functions
    - Storing Genetic info
        - Gene 
            - Segment of DNA that directs protein synthesis
            - Piece of dna that has instructions to create a specific protein
        - Genome
            - total of DNA in an organisms chromosomes
    - Replication of info
    - expression of info
    - occasionally change info
