## DNA Functions

- functions
    - Storing Genetic info
        - **Gene** 
            - Segment of DNA that directs protein synthesis
            - Piece of dna that has instructions to create a specific protein
        - **Genome**
            - total of DNA in an organisms chromosomes
    - Replication of info
        - Occurs in the S phase of cell cycle (interphase)
            - Strands of double helix unzip
            - Single strands are templates for creation of new double strands
            - Nucleotides added in precise sequence: G-C and A-T
        - New DNA molecule
            - one strand from original molecule
            - another strand built using that parental strand as a template
    - expression of info
        - Cells environment can influence wich genes are expressed
        - GXE interaction (Genotype by Environment)
        - Two Processes:
            - **Transcription**
                - copy of gene message made from DNA template using RNA building blocks
                - **RNA**: contains ribose instead of dioxyribose sugars, single stranded, thyamine replaced by uracil
            - **Translation**
                - RNA translated to produce proteins
                - occurs in cytoplasm
    - occasionally change info
        - All genetic variability is due to mutations
            - **Mutations**: changes in DNA sequence
            - **Mutagens**: agents that alter the DNA sequence
                - ex: UV light, radiation, chemicals
        - DNA repair enzymes can often find/correct damage

## DNA vs RNA

## Genetic Code

- Based on **Codons**
    - three nucleotides
        - 64 possible combinations that code for 20 amino acids
- Order of nucleotides on mRNA determines sequence of aino acids during translation
- genetic code universal - in bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and animals

#### Central Dogma of Molecular Genetics

- Flow of info is unidirectional from DNA to RNA to Protein

## Cytogenetics

- **Cytogenetics**: study of chomosome and structure frim a genetic pt of view
- Changes in chromosome structure
    - **Inversion** chromosomal pirce breaks and reinserts in opposite orientation
        - not rearraged by meiosis and inherited in blocks
    - **Translocation**: chromosomal piece breaks off and attaches to another chromosome
- Can happen during DNA replication

## Changes in Chromosome Number

- Happens durign Meiosis (anaphase)
- **Aneuploid**: carries one or more extra chromsome or is missing one or more chromsomes
- **Polyploid**: has at least one complete extra set of chromosomes
    - fusion of gametes
    - meiosis fails to halve chromosome number, resulting in 2 n gametes

## Gregor Mendel

- Crossed Peas
- Father of modern genetics
- selected plants with different forms of the same trait
    - Ex.: Height
- Parental Generation (P)
    - all generation was tall
- First Fillial generation (F1)
    - Crossing offspring yielded ratio of three tall individuals to one short individual
- Second fillial (F2)
    - offspring of F1

## Terms

- **Homologous chromosomes**: Each member of the chrom pair each derived from different parent
- **Locus**: position of a gene on a chrom
- **Allele**: one of at least two alternative forms of a gene
- **Homozygous**: having two identical alleles at the same locus
- **Heterozygous**: having two different alleles at the same locus
- **Dominant**: an allele that when present will mask the presence of all other alleles
- **Recessive**: an allele whose phenotype is only seen in the absense of dominant alleles
- **Genotype**: genetic constitution of an individual organism
- **Phenotype**: the set of observable characteristics of an indvidual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment

## Mendelian Laws

- Law of unit characters
    - alleles always occur in pairs, control inheritance of various characteristics
- Law of Dominance
    - one dominant allele masks the expression of the recessive alleles

## Monohybrid cross

## Class Questions

#### Meiosis Review

Q. What is the purpose of Meiosis?
A. **Create genetic diversity among offspring**

Q. Which of the following contributes most to creating unique genetic combos found in gametes after meiosis?
A. **Homologous chromosomes exchange genetic info via crossing over during Prophase I**

## Mol Bio

Q. A segment of DNA that directs the synthesis of a protein is:
A. **Gene**

Q. How does DNA express info?
A. **By transcribing its genetic code into mRNA**

Q. What happens after mRNA is transcribed?
A. **mRNA is translated into proteins at the ribosomes**

Q. Which best describes the result of DNA mutations:
A. **Mutations may alter the structure and function of proteins, ranging from no impact to complete loss of function**

Q. What tyoe of chromosomal structural change has occured when a piece of cromosome is broken and reinserted upside-down?
A. **Inversion**
