Need to do Rater Practice

### Review

What to look for to determine if an unknown sample is alive
- Response to stimuli
- Adaptation to environment (long term, natural selection/evolution)
- growth (gets bigger, volume/mass) - if single cell, will divide
- reproduction (multiplies, sexual/asexual) - offspring look like parent
- Metabolism (respiration, digestion) - using energy for things like photosynthesis to break down ATP/sugars, assimilation 
- Structure/Organization (has cells) - cellular basis


Q. What is collective product of all biochemical reactions taking place within an organism? 
A. **Metabolism**

Q. `____` bonds are formed when positively charged H atoms in polar moleules and negatively charged atoms in other poler molecules.
A. **Hydrogen** - any bond specifically w/ Hydrogen

Q. `____` occurs when water molecules are attacted to other water molecules: 
A. **Cohesion** - like attract like

## Chemical Components of Cells

Slide 6

Building blocks of all life

### Carbohydrates

Most abundant organic molecules
- Contain carbon, Hydrogen and ocygen in ratio of CH20

Three basic kinds

    - Monosaccharides
        - Glucose & Fructose
    - Disacharides
        - Sucrose
    - Polysacharides
        - Starch - main carb reserve of plants
        - Cellulose - main structural polymer in plant cell walls

### Lipids

Fatty/oily substances that are mostly insoluble in water
- long term energy reserves
- structural components in cells

Include waxes (found on leaf stem surfaces) and phospholipids (important for membranes)

Vegetable oils - extracted from seeds

Q. Carbohydrates are essential for plant biology bc they:
A. **Serve as a primary energy source and structual component in plants**

### Proteins, Polypeptides && Amino Acids

Proteins rgulate chemical reactions in cells are usually veru large and consist of one or more polypeptide chains 
- composed of chains of amino acids
- Each Amino acids composed of 
    - Amino group (-NH2)
    - Caroxyl group (-COOH)
    - R group

Primary/Secondary Polypeptide Structure (slide 12)

Primary Structure

Seconday Structure 
- H Bonds

Tertiary Struct

Quaternary Struct

Q. Which type of bonds enable Polypeptide Structure?

A. **Hydrogen bonds**

### Enzymes

Mostly Large complex proteins that catalyze reactions
- Lower the energy of activation
- Energy of activation is the minimal amount of energry neeeded to cause molecules to react with one another

### Nucleic Acids

Very large complex polymers made of **nucleitides**

DNA 
- Double Helix
- Contains genes

RNA 
- Single strand
- Involved in protein synthesis

Q. Each protein molecule can contain polypeptides which are chains of `____`:
A. **Amino Acids**

Q. Which polymers work by lowering activation energy?
A. **Peptides**

# Cells 

Chapter 3
All living organizisms are composed of cells and cells forma a unifying structural basis of organization

### Cells History

1665 - Firs cells discovered by Robert Hooke
- Cork tree cells

### Modern Microscopes

**Dissecting Microscope**
- AKA Steromicroscopes
- ALlow three dimensional viewing of opaque objects
- 30x magnifying

**Compound Microscope**
- Light passes through thinly sliced material
- distinguish organelles 2 micrometers or larger
- 1500x magnification

**Electron Microscope**
- Transmission
    - 200,000x magnification
    - extremely thin slice of material
- Scanning
    - 10,000x magnification
    - Surface detail of thick objects

## Intro to Cells 

All living things composed of cells
- organized

### Two Catagories

Prkaryotic Cells
- Lack nucleus
- Bacteria

Eukaryotic Cells
- Cells with nucleus
- Organelles - membrane bound bodies found in eukaryotic cells
- Unicellular eukararyotes, fungi, plants, animals

### Cell Structure

Slide 21

**Cytoplasm** - All cellular components between the plasma membrane and nucleus
- **Cytosol** - Fluid within cytoplasm containing organelles
- **Orgonelles** - Structures with specialiezd functions 
    - Most are bound by membranes

### Cell Size

vary between 10 and 100 micrometers
Smaller cells - Large surface to volume ratio
Larger cells - Volume grows much more than its area

Q. In order to observe 3D structure of cellular ocmponents which microscope should be used?
A. **Scanning Electon Mic**

Q. Which can be found in both Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells?
A. **Cell wall**

## Anatomy of a Young Plant Cell

#### Cell Wall

Made of **cellulose** - long chains of glucose (polysacharide)

### Communication Between Cells

**Prasmodesmata** - Cytoplasmic strands extendidng between cells
- Allows fluids and dissolved substances to pass between adjacent cells

Signaling molecules can move between walls

### Plasma Membrane

Semipermeable outer boundary of the livig part of the cell (surrounding cell)

Regulate movement of substances into and out of cell

Composed of phospholipid bilayer, proteins interspersed throughout

### Lipid Bilayer

Slide 31

Q. What are the most important functions of the cell wall in plants?
A. **Support and Protection**

Q. Which Describes plasma membrane of plant cell?
A. **Semipermiable barrier** whch can allow ingibit or regulate the movement of substances in and out of the cell

### Nucleus

Contains DNA

Sends coded messahes from DNA to be used

### Endoplasmic reticulum

Network throughout the cytoplasm
- Facilitates cellular communication and channeling of materials

Rough v. Smooth ER

### Ribosomes 

Where proteins are made

### Dictosomes/Golgi bodies

Where polysaccarides are collected

### Plastids - Chloroplasts

Site of Photosynthesis

**Grana** made up of thylakoids

**Thylakoid membrains** Contain chlorophyl
- first steps of photosynthesis happen here

**Stroma** Matrix of enzymes involved in PS

- Small circular DNA molecule - encodes production of certain proteins for photosynthesis

### Mitochondria
 
release energy produced from cellular respiration

### Vacules

Maintain cell pressure, without pressure cell will collapse
- Process that starts if dont water your plants 

Storage of numerous cell metabolites and wasyer products

### Cytokseleton
slide 38

provides tracks for various components to move around on

### Additional

**Chromoplasts** Synthesize and accumulate carotenoids
**Leucoplasts** - Colorless; May synthesize starches

**Microbodies** - small, spjereical bodies distributed thoughout the cytoplasm
- Help plant determine which way is down through gravity. Provide a way for plants to respond to stimuli. Plants will grow down.
