## Intro to Plants

### Plants 

What do we know about plants already?
- Photosynthesis: take in water, sunlight, CO2 and get out oxygen, glucose
- Flowers translate to fruits
- Roots grow into soil, add stability to environments
- Respirators
- Big source of our food, animals get enregy from food
- Moss, fern, horsetails 

Plant facts:
- plants make up 98% of total biomass of the earth (insects are largest indiv. group)
- Convert CO2 to H2O
- Without plants oxygen on earth would be gone in 11 years (estimate)

### Importance of Plants

Plants provide:
- 90% of the worlds foods
- Important medicinal drugs & narcotic drugs

#### Plant products in society 

Food
- Directly consumed 
- Indirectly consumed through animals

Beverages
- tea
- beer

Lumber
Paper
Perfumes
Dyes, adhesives, food stabilizers

Source of:
- Clothing
- medicines 
- coal/oil
- energy source

## Botany is a Science

### Scientific Method

Procedure for developing and testing a hypothesis

Method: Ask Q -> Formulate hypothesis -> Conduct experiment -> Develop theory

Hypothesis - Tentative unproven explanation of an observation
- Needs to be answered in yes/no format
- Needs to seek objective outcome 

Testing: ID question (consult prior knowledge) -> form hypothesis -> collect data -> interpret results (if hypothesis rejected return to form hypothesis) (consult prior knowledge) -> report for peer review -> publish findings

Findings can be disproven later
- Ex. Earth believed to be center of universe
Changed by:
- new technology
- retesting old hypothesis

#### Expirementation 

Must be **repeatable**

Variables: aspects of the expirement that can be changed or held constant

Carried out w/ control vs expiremental group
- Expiremental gets experiemental treatment 
- control is the same except does not get expiremental treatment

#### Data Analysis

Data: accumulated results from experiment 

Data analysis can lead to:
- Principle: useful generalization derived from expiremental group
- Theory: grouping of related principles

Theory:
- can be disproven later, never reaches absolute proof
- vs law: law involves math formula that explains the phenomena

## Diversification of Plant Study

Disciplines: Anatomy, Physiology, Taxonomy, Systematics, Geography, Ecology, Morphology, 

Genetics
- Heredity
- genetic engineering
- genomics
- Bioinoformatics: CS + statistics + biology = analyze  DNA & RNA

# Nature of Life
(Chapter 2)

## Attributes of Living Organisms

### Organizations and Structure

Cells: Structural units of organism
- Molecules organized into compartments, membranes
- arrangement of molecules are highly structured and complex

### Growth and Reproduction

Growth:
- Increase in mass && volume
- Results from production of new cells and include variation in form
- Controlled by genetics and environment
- Environment plays a roll in what genes are turned on/off

Reproduction:
- Production of offspring
- Always resemble parents 

### Response to Stimuli and Metabolism

Response to Stimuli:
- Plants respond to gravity, injury, light, temp

Metabolism
- Collection of all biochemical reactions in an organism

### Adaptation to Environment

Adaptation:
- Living organisms respond to environment
- Most adaptable organisms in their environment will be most successful (natural selection)

Example Q: Which of the following is true of plant growth:
A: Controlled by genetic comp and environment where it is grown

## Chemical and Physical Bases of Life

Matter:
- Solid, liquid, gas
- Occupies space
- has mass
- composed of elements

Atoms - Smallest stable subdivision of Element:
- Nucleus: Center of Atom
- Protons: Pos charges
- Neutrons: Neutral charges

Atomic Number - Number of protons:
- Cannot change in an element
Atomic mass - Combined # of protons and neutrons

### Molecules

Molecule - Two or more atoms bound together
- Smallest independantly existing particle of a compound or element

Compound - Two or more elements united in  a definite ratio by chem bonds

### Bonds 

Forces that form molecules by attracting and holding atoms together

Three types: (Slide 30)
- Covalent
- Ionic
- H

#### Hydrogen Bond

Weak bond
Form as a result of attraction between pos charged H atoms && negatively charged atoms in other polar molecules

### Chemical Reactions

Random collisions between molecules 
- Results in formation of new molecules
- Controlled by specific enzymes (catalyst) - enzyme allow reactions to happen with less energy
- Need much more energy without enzymes
- Catalyst Speeds up reaction

### Water Molecules 

Two H atoms bound to one oxygen
- Asymmetrical shapes - polarity effects alignment
- Cohesian: attraction of similar molecules
- Adhesian: attraction of dissimilar molecules

### pH Scale

Acids: chemicals that release H atoms when dissolved in water
Bases: alkaline compounds that release hydroxyl ions (OH-) when dissolved in water

#### pH Measures H+ ions concentration
7 = neutral
< 7 = Acidic
greater than 7 = alkaline ( greater the number is more alkaline )
- plants prefer neutral or a little acidic or a little base

## Energy

Energy: Capacity to perform work to produce a change

Thermodynamics: Study of energy and its conversions from one form to another
- First Law: Energy is constant - cannot be gained/lost only converted from one form to another
- Second law: when energy is converted it flows from high energy to low energy state. releases energy during conversion
