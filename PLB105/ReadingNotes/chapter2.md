## 2.1 Attributes of Living Organisms 

### Organization and Structure

- Cells contain genetic material called **DNA**(deoxyribonucleic acid) house in nucleus that is suspended in the cytoplasm
- In bacteria DNA is not in the nucleaus
- Plants algae fungi and bacteria have **cell wall** outside the membrane for rigidity
- Cells composed of **molecules** (smallest units/elements if a compound)
- Bacteria are simplest known cells, each cell contains min of 600 diff kinds of proteing and hundreds of other substances

### Growth

- increase in mass = **growth**
- usually accomponied by increase in volume
- growth results from production of new cells which cause variation in form
- growth is controlled by geenetic makeup and environment

### Reproduction

- Offspring resemble the parents

### Response to Stimuli

- **callose** is substance plugged in by plants into pierced tissue
- **callus** = mass of cells formed at the smae site 
- plants respond to injury and other stimuli such as light, temp, gravity

### Metabolism

- **respiration** - energy releasing process
- **photosynthesis** - energy-harnessing process in green cells thats associated with energy storage
- **digestion** - breakdown of food molecules
- **assimulation** conversion of raw materials into cytoplasm and other cell substances

## 2.2 Chemical and Physical Bases of life

### Elements: Units of Matter

- basics of universe - stuff exists as *solid, liquid and gas* 
    1. Occupies space
    2. has mass - most of the times weight too
    3. composed of **elements** - 98 naturally occuring on earth
- smallest subdivision of an element is an **atom** - consisting of necleus which consists of protons and neutrons

- atoms live about 10^35 years
- Region around necleus is an **orbital**

### Combos of Elements

- two or more elements untied in a defintie ratio by chamical bonds is called a **compound**
- **molecule** - two or more atoms bound together and is the smallest independently existing particle of a compound or an element

### Valence

- Ability of an element to comvine with another one is based on electron number called **valence**

### Bonds And Ions

- Covalent vs ionic vs hydrogen

### Random Definitions

refer to chapter for more info

- **energy** - capacity to do work or produce change
