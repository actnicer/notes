# Chp 10 - Plant Metabolism

## 10.1 - Intro

Metabolism - interrelated biochemical process in living org

## 10.2 - Enzymes & Energy Transfer

- **Anabolism** - chemical bonds built by enzymes
- **Catabolism** - enzymes break chemical bonds

- During the process of cellular respiration the chemical bonds in sugar molecules are broken and energy is released.
- Oxidation reduction reaction
    - When an atom or molecule is oxidized, the electron that is removed is transferred to another atom or molecule, which is thereby reduced.
- Cells are constantly producing the short-lived enzymeField **ATP molecules**, which supply energy to perform most metabolic tasks at a cellular level.
- **Cellular Respiration** - series of chemical reactions that break the chemical bonds in sugars, releasing the energy contained within?
- While the atmosphere contains only about 400 parts per million of CO2, that is enough to supply all the carbon demand for global photosynthesis.
- **Photorespiration**
    - Light intensities and temperatures can get too high for optimal photosynthesis. Under these conditions, plants will switch from photosynthesis to which "wasteful" process that does not fix carbon into sugar?
    - It may help some plants survive under adverse conditions.
    - It uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
    - The rate goes up as temperatures increase.
- **Calvin Cycle** (c3)
    - Through several steps, glucose is synthesized.
    - CO2 from the air and RuBP are combined.
    - NADPH and ATP, produced during the light-dependent reactions, supply electrons and energy.
    - The first stable substance produced is a 3-carbon compound.
    - Because the first molecule into which the inorganic CO2 is fixed has three carbon atoms
- **Photon** - A particle of light that acts as a discrete bundle of energy
    - The energy can be released as heat.
    - The pigment can fluoresce or phosphoresce.
    - The absorbed energy can eventually be stored in chemical bonds.
- Chlorophyll 
    - The tail anchors chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane
    - Each molecule contains one atom of magnesium.
    - It is a green pigment.
    - It absorbs the sun's energy.
- C4 plants use C3 photosynthesis in different cells, whereas CAM plants use C3 photosynthesis at certain times
- CAM plants close their stomata during the day and open them at night.
    - both C4 and CAM plants also use C3 photosynthesis
- Glycosis
    - It is the first major step in respiration.
    - Oxygen is not required.
    - It happens in the cytoplasm of the cell.
